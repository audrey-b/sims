Description: Generates data from R or 'JAGS' code for use in
    simulation studies.  The data are returned as an 'nlist::nlists'
    object and/or saved to file as individual '.rds' files.
    Parallelization is implemented using the 'future' package.  Progress
    is reported using the 'progressr' package.
