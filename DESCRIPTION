Description: Generates data from R or 'JAGS' code for use in simulation
    studies.  The data are returned as an 'nlist::nlists' object and/or
    saved to file as individual '.rds' files.  Parallelization is
    implemented using the 'future' package.  Progress is reported using
    the 'progressr' package.
